# Introduction to ES6 (ECMAScript 2015)

ES6, also called ECMAScript 2015, is a major update to JavaScript that introduced many new features and improvements. These updates make JavaScript easier to write, read, and maintain. ES6 brings modern syntax, powerful tools, and better ways to work with objects, arrays, and functions. This repository covers the most important ES6 concepts with examples and explanations.

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Arrow Functions**: Arrow functions allow writing functions in a shorter and cleaner way. They also handle the `this` keyword differently, which can prevent common bugs.  
- **Classes**: ES6 introduced classes as a modern way to create objects and define object-oriented behavior. Classes make inheritance, constructors, and methods simpler to manage.  
- **Default Parameters**: Functions in ES6 can have default values for parameters, so if a value is not provided, it automatically uses the default.  
- **Destructuring**: Destructuring makes it easy to extract values from arrays or objects and assign them to variables in a single line.  
- **Dot & Bracket Notation**: Two ways to access object properties — dot notation is simple, and bracket notation allows dynamic property access.  
- **Object Methods**:  
  - `Object.entries()` – Converts an object into an array of key-value pairs.  
  - `Object.freeze()` – Prevents an object from being changed.  
  - `Object.seal()` – Allows modifying values but prevents adding or removing properties.  
- **Array Methods**: ES6 introduces many useful array methods for easier manipulation:  
  - `forEach()` – Loops through array elements.  
  - `map()` – Creates a new array by transforming each element.  
  - `filter()` – Creates a new array with elements that meet a condition.  
  - `find()` – Returns the first element that meets a condition.  
  - `reduce()` – Reduces an array to a single value by applying a function.  
- **Inheritance**: Classes can inherit from other classes, allowing code reuse and relationships between objects.  
- **let & const**: Block-scoped variables. `let` is used for variables that can change, while `const` is for values that should not be reassigned.  
- **Spread Operator**: `...` allows copying, merging, or spreading arrays and objects in a simple way.  
- **Template Strings**: Strings can include variables and expressions directly using backticks ` `` `, making string creation easier and readable.  
- **`this` Keyword**: In ES6, `this` behaves differently in arrow functions compared to traditional functions, helping avoid context-related bugs.  
- **Object Looping**: You can loop through objects using `for...in`, `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, or `Object.entries()` to access keys and values efficiently.  

ES6 has transformed the way developers write JavaScript. It makes code cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain. By learning these concepts, you can write modern, professional, and efficient JavaScript code. This repository contains examples and explanations for each feature, helping you understand and use ES6 effectively in your projects.
